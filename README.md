# CodeInfinity_Test1

> This project is my interpritation of the requriements stated in the test document.

This project has allowed me to learn/update alot of new skills and gain experience in new languages I previously had very little in.

Such as:
  * PHP 
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * MongoDB
 
During the course this project I have used various resourses in order to gain a better grasp of these technologys aswell as for debuging.

They include:
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Used to learn about HTML CSS.
* [PHP Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUCiSSyIGGU) - To learn PHP.
* [PHP Documentation](https://www.php.net/)
* [MongoDB Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/)
* [Useful explenation of how to connect PHP and Mongodb together](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_php.htm#)
